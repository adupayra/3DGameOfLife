# 3DGameOfLife
Basic game of life in 3D using openGL with GLSL

#Introduction

Personal project made to learn  C++ and discover graphics computing.

The project is kind of minimal, it doesn't contain features and wasn't aimed to be perfect in term of speed or use of resources. 

Obvious improvements could be to make some thread computation for the rendering part as well as for the state updating part.
It could also be interesting to make more advanced post process effects.

This was a good project to put my hands on C++ as well as on the basics of computer graphics.
